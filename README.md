# 2022-2023-Faculty-Adopter-Modules
This is a repository compiling the data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's Center for Applied Data Science (CADS) Faculty Adopter program which began in 2020. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions.

This repository aims to be a central open-source resource for all modules and materials created as a part of the Faculty Adopter program to be used either in a referential or adoptive context to help further the teaching of data science in various fields of education.
