This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 

# Finance and Economics in Sport
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of the Finance and Economics in Sport SPM 3311 course taught by Dr. Sangkwon Lee. The SPM 3311 course is offered every year in the Fall at Winston-Salem State University from the Health, Physical Education, and Sport Studies department. The majority of students who enroll in this course are those majoring in sports management. However, this course is also intended for all students whose interests and/or professional goals involve business in sports/sports analytics.

TThe topics in this module include: data analysis, descriptive statistics, statistical inference, correlation/covariance, graphing and tabulation, analysis of variance, regression/predictive analysis, and how these can and are applied to sport business.

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will understand why data management and analysis are crucial in financial management of sport business.
* Students will demonstrate how to collect data relevant to the topics, analyze the data, and apply the skills to sport financial and economic issues.
* Students be able to explain inferential analysis and conduct a variety of types of regression analysis.
* Students will conduct economic/financial impact research by using knowledge of data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
* Students will be exposed to data analysis software such as Jamovi, SPSS, and Stata.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. This module was classified into three sub-modules:
* Descriptive Analysis
* Regression Analysis
* Multiple Regression Analysis
