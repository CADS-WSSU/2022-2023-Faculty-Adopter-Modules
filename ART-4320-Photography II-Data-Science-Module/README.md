# ART4320-Photography II-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 

# Photography II
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of the Photography II course taught by Ms. Hye Young Kim. The Photography II course is offered every year in the Fall at Winston-Salem State University. This course is primarily intended for art majors, or those with an interest in art/photography.

The primary focus of this course designed to build on the knowledge of digital photography and it's use as a tool for artists that the student acquired in ART 3354 (Photography I). Attention is given to advanced aesthetic principles and concepts. 

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will identify and demonstrate photography shooting techniques, photography editing techniques and photography compositions.
* Students will analyze and apply the conceptual, technical and aesthetic elements through creating photographs.  
* Students will describe, analyze and evaluate art project using photography vocabulary through constructive and thoughtful critiques.
* Students will demonstrate image processing tasks with Python in the perspective of data science.
* Students will apply image processing tasks on digital photos with Python for creative projects. 

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. This module primarily focused on:
* Introduction to Python and Anaconda
* Image Processing  and color analysis with Python
