# MAT2326-Elementary-Statistics-Data-Science-Module
This is a repository containing the material regarding data science modules implemented as a part of Winston-Salem State University's [Center for Applied Data Science (CADS)](https://www.wssu.edu/academics/colleges-and-departments/college-of-arts-sciences-business-education/center-for-applied-data-science/index.html) Faculty Adopter program. The Faculty Adopter Program is designed to support enthusiastic faculty who are willing to infuse data science into their courses across various disciplines and are capable of quantitatively and qualitatively assessing the impact of their interventions. 

# Elementary Statistics
This respository contains the data science infusion adopter modules of the Elementary Statistics course taught by Dr. John O. Adeyeye. The Elementary Statistics course is offered every year in the Fall at Winston-Salem State University. This course is primarily intended for mathematics majors, or those with an interest in basic statistics.

The primary focus of this course is the use of statistics as a tool when faced with the process of making important decisions. Topics such as common statistical measures, graphing techniques, probability, the standard normal distribution, z-tests, t-tests, correlations and prediction, and chi-square tests will be covered.

# Learning Outcomes
* Students will be provided a basis for studying specialized methods within the major fields.
* Students will be introduced to the ideas of central tendency, variability, uncertainty, and some statistical methods for drawing inference from observed data.
* Students will use statistics in the decision making processes within their fields.
* Students will develop an appreciation for the role of statistics in society.

# Data Science Infusion
The primary focus of this repository concerns only the portion of the course where the data science infusion modules were implemented as part of the CADS adopter program. This module was classified into three broad units:
* Exploring Data
* From Exploration to Inference
* Inference about Variables and Relationships
